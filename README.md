Miro's World 2.0
=================

The continuation of the [old Wordpress blog](http://miroadamy.com) with more agreeable tools: Gollum, Markdown and Git.

There is no code here. The reason for this repo to exist is the attached Wiki.

Please see the [Wiki to this repo](https://github.com/radegast/miroadamy-dot-com/wiki) for the actual blog entries. 

I do not really like Wordpress as publishing platform, so all new entries will now be now on GitHub.

Update - 2016-03-15
===================

There is now 3.0 version of this based on Jekyll, which contains import of previous posts from Wordpress.
See [Miro's World Take 3](http://miroadamy.github.io/)

This is repo is obsolete.
